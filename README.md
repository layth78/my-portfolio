This website was created by me, it has 5 HTML pages, and 1 CSS file linked to the pages. The webiste also have 1 file of JavaScript that has a set of codes with a loop variable for the pictures that I have under Project Gallery tab, is to make the pictures clickable. I have 2 HTML pages with forms to fill out with interactivity, is when you fill out the form and hit submit, the browser will display an alert telling the user that his/her form has been submitted. I have coded some JavaScript code for the form interactivity. The website is also a resposive website, I used media queries rule lovated in the CSS file, to make the website responive is when you shrink the browser from left to right, the screen will adjust to show a tablet view and a mobile view for the webiste if you open it on those devices.
